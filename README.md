# ClearPendingTitles

.CIA/.3dsx app that uses am:sys to clear pending title installations for NAND and SD. Nothing special.

## Compilation

Requires ctrulib, makerom, and bannertool. Running "make" will generate an installable CIA as well as a .3dsx for the HBL (requires am:sys access, any \*hax should do).
